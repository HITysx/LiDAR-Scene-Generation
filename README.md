# Enhancing Realism in LiDAR Scene Generation with CSPA-DFN and Linear Cross-Attention via Diffusion Transformer Model
This repository contains the code implementation of the paper "Enhancing Realism in LiDAR Scene Generation with CSPA-DFN and Linear Cross-Attention via Diffusion Transformer Model"

## Abstract
This paper proposes a novel LiDAR Diffusion Transformer Model that integrates Channel-Spatial Parallel Attention and Dilation Fusion Network (CSPA-DFN) with a linear cross-attention post-processing module to refine the generated LiDAR scene samples. The model has been evaluated on the unconditional generation task using the KITTI-360 and nuScenes datasets. Furthermore, by incorporating semantic labels and camera views into the latent space, in addition to enhancing the model's semantic understanding capability for LiDAR scenes, the method also demonstrates additional performance improvements compared to previous works in terms of LiDAR scene's visual quality.
